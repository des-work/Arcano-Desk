### **AI Model Selection Logic**
The system automatically analyzes content and selects the optimal model:

```typescript
// Content Analysis Factors
- Word Count: <500 (simple), 500-2000 (medium), 2000-5000 (complex), >5000 (very complex)
- Topic Density: Technical terms and academic language detection
- Sentence Complexity: Average sentence length analysis
- Context Window: Ensures content fits within model limits
```

### **Supported File Types**
- **PDF**: Text extraction with OCR fallback
- **Word (.docx)**: Full document processing
- **PowerPoint (.pptx)**: Slide content extraction
- **Text (.txt)**: Direct text processing

## üé® Customization

- Magical animations and effects
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### **Model Configuration**
You can customize the AI model selection by:
- Adding new models to the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` array
- Adjusting complexity scoring thresholds
- Modifying model selection logic in `contentAnalyzer.ts`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Cannot find module 'path-browserify'"**
   ```bash
   npm install path-browserify --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Ollama Connection Issues**
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Check if models are downloaded: `ollama list`
   - Verify Ollama is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`

3. **File Upload Problems**
   - Check file format is supported
   - Ensure file size is reasonable (<50MB recommended)
   - Try with a smaller file first

4. **Model Selection Issues**
   - Verify models are installed: `ollama list`
   - Check model names match exactly
   - Ensure sufficient system resources

## üìà Performance Tips

- **Model Selection**: Smaller models (2B-3B) for simple tasks, larger models (7B+) for complex analysis
- **File Size**: Keep individual files under 50MB for optimal processing
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple small files rather than one large file
- **Memory**: Ensure sufficient RAM for larger models (8GB+ recommended for 7B+ models)
